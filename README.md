At this point you can run `npm start` to see the example app at `http://localhost:3300`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3300](http://localhost:3300) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

It correctly bundles JavaScript, SCSS, images in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
